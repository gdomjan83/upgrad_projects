These are the Python projects I created. The project ideas were found on the upgrad.com site.

Project 1 - Number guessing game - FINISHED

	This is a small guessing game. You have to guess a number between 1 and 100. If you can't guess it, you will be given hints about the number.

Project 2 - Simple text adventure game - FINISHED

	This is a small text adventure game, where the player can move through different rooms.

Project 3 - A dice rolling program - FINISHED

	You can roll one or more dices (6, 8, 10, 20, 100 sided) and get the individual rolls as the result, and also the total roll. 

Project 4 - Hangman - FINISHED

	The game gives you a random word from a list (these are imported from a txt file), and you can play a hangman game with that word.
